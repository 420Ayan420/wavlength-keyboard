# wavelength-keyboard
A custom ortholinear bluetooth mechanical keyboard with a left-sided numpad. Supports low-proflie Kalih Choc(olate) switches and has additonal dev-connectors for accessing the MCU for other projects such as the [analog gauge based task manager](https://github.com/420Ayan420/analog-task-manager), etc.

Completed the layout for the keyboard, I am using ortholinear as it is more comfortable and natural to type on. Using [KLE](http://www.keyboard-layout-editor.com/) (keyboard layout editor) you can open the `layout.json` file to edit/view it to your needs.
